# Rust Essentials

* Rust deals with low-level Details of Memory Management, Data Representation, and Concurrency

## Environment

* __rustc__: Compiler which takes Rust Code and compiles it into Binary (Machine-readable Code)
* __rustup__: Command Line Utility to install and update Rust
* __cargo__: Rust Build System and Package Manager

## Errors

* Panicking in Rust means Errors during the Runtime
